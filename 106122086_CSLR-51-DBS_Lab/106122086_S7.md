# Lab 7

### Step 1: **Create the Database**

```sql
-- Create Database
CREATE DATABASE CompanyFlightDB;
USE CompanyFlightDB;
```

### Step 2: **Create Tables**

#### Employee Schema
```sql
-- Employee table
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    birthdate DATE,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    department_id INT
);

-- Department table
CREATE TABLE Department (
    department_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    location VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Project table
CREATE TABLE Project (
    project_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    project_name VARCHAR(50),
    department_id INT,
    location VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES Department(department_id)
);

-- Dependent table
CREATE TABLE Dependent (
    dependent_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    birthdate DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES Employee(employee_id)
);

-- Works table (Employees working on projects)
CREATE TABLE Works (
    employee_id INT,
    project_id INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_id, project_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES Employee(employee_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES Project(project_id)
);
```

#### Flight Schema
```sql
-- Pilot table
CREATE TABLE Pilot (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Certified table (Certifications for employees on specific aircraft)
CREATE TABLE Certified (
    employee_id INT,
    aircraft_id INT,
    certification_date DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (employee_id, aircraft_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (employee_id) REFERENCES Employee(employee_id)
);

-- Aircraft table
CREATE TABLE Aircraft (
    aircraft_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    cruising_range INT
);

-- Flight table
CREATE TABLE Flight (
    flight_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    aircraft_id INT,
    distance INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (aircraft_id) REFERENCES Aircraft(aircraft_id)
);
```

---

### Step 3: **Insert Sample Data**

Now, insert values into the tables that adhere to the constraints and triggers.

#### Employee Data
```sql
-- Insert employees
INSERT INTO Employee (employee_id, name, birthdate, salary, department_id) VALUES
(1, 'John Doe', '1980-01-01', 60000, 1),
(2, 'Jane Smith', '1990-02-02', 55000, 1),
(3, 'Mark Johnson', '1975-03-03', 50000, 2);

-- Insert departments
INSERT INTO Department (department_id, name, location) VALUES
(1, 'HR', 'New York'),
(2, 'Finance', 'Los Angeles');

-- Insert projects
INSERT INTO Project (project_id, project_name, department_id, location) VALUES
(1, 'Project Alpha', 1, 'New York'),
(2, 'Project Beta', 2, 'Los Angeles');

-- Insert dependents
INSERT INTO Dependent (dependent_id, employee_id, name, birthdate) VALUES
(1, 1, 'Dependent 1', '2010-05-05'),
(2, 2, 'Dependent 2', '2015-06-06'),
(3, 3, 'Dependent 3', '2008-07-07');
```

#### Works Data (Employee-Project Association)
```sql
-- Employees working on projects
INSERT INTO Works (employee_id, project_id) VALUES
(1, 1),
(2, 1),
(3, 2);
```

#### Pilot Data
```sql
-- Insert pilots
INSERT INTO Pilot (employee_id, name, salary) VALUES
(4, 'Pilot A', 70000),
(5, 'Pilot B', 80000);

-- Insert certifications
INSERT INTO Certified (employee_id, aircraft_id, certification_date) VALUES
(4, 1, '2022-01-01'),
(5, 2, '2023-02-02');
```

#### Aircraft and Flight Data
```sql
-- Insert aircraft
INSERT INTO Aircraft (aircraft_id, cruising_range) VALUES
(1, 5000),
(2, 6000);

-- Insert flights
INSERT INTO Flight (flight_id, aircraft_id, distance) VALUES
(1, 1, 4500),
(2, 2, 5500);
```

### 1. **Employee Schema Triggers**

#### a. Assure that deleting details of an employee deletes his dependent records also.
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER delete_employee_cascade
AFTER DELETE ON Employee
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM Dependent WHERE employee_id = OLD.employee_id;
END;
```



#### b. When a department with exactly one project is shifted to a new location, ensure that the project is also shifted to the new location.
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER shift_project_location
AFTER UPDATE OF location ON Department
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Project WHERE department_id = OLD.department_id) = 1
BEGIN
  UPDATE Project SET location = NEW.location WHERE department_id = OLD.department_id;
END;
```

#### c. Assure at all times that there are no departments with more than 3 projects.
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER limit_department_projects
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON Project
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Project WHERE department_id = NEW.department_id) >= 3
BEGIN
  SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'A department cannot have more than 3 projects';
END;
```

#### d. Assure that no employees work for more than one department.
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER unique_department_per_employee
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON Works
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  IF (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Works WHERE employee_id = NEW.employee_id) > 1 THEN
    SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'An employee cannot work for more than one department';
  END IF;
END;
```

#### e. When a project is dropped, dissociate all the employees from that particular project.
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER drop_project
AFTER DELETE ON Project
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM Works WHERE project_id = OLD.project_id;
END;
```

#### f. When a new department is inaugurated, ensure that it is not co-located with any other departments.
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER check_department_location
BEFORE INSERT ON Department
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  IF (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Department WHERE location = NEW.location) > 0 THEN
    SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'A department cannot be co-located with any other department';
  END IF;
END;
```

#### g. For every employee, ensure that his dependent's birthdate is less than his own.
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER check_dependent_birthdate
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON Dependent
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  IF (SELECT birthdate FROM Employee WHERE employee_id = NEW.employee_id) <= NEW.birthdate THEN
    SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Dependent birthdate must be less than employee birthdate';
  END IF;
END;
```

#### h. Increment 1000 rupees to the salary if any of his/her dependents expire.
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER increment_salary_on_dependent_death
AFTER DELETE ON Dependent
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  UPDATE Employee SET salary = salary + 1000 WHERE employee_id = OLD.employee_id;
END;
```

---

### 2. **Flight Schema Triggers**

#### i. Create a trigger that handles an update command to find the total salary of all pilots.
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER check_total_pilot_salary
BEFORE UPDATE ON Pilot
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  IF NEW.salary IS NULL OR NEW.salary < 50000 THEN
    SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Pilot salary must be greater than 50,000';
  END IF;
END;
```

#### j. Create a trigger to set salary as 30,000 if NULL is present. Ensure the salary of a pilot is greater than a non-pilot.
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER set_default_salary_if_null
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON Employee
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  IF NEW.salary IS NULL THEN
    SET NEW.salary = 30000;
  END IF;
  
  IF (NEW.role = 'Pilot' AND NEW.salary <= (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee WHERE role != 'Pilot')) THEN
    SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Pilot salary must be greater than non-pilot salary';
  END IF;
END;
```

#### k. Create a trigger to foil any attempt to lower the salary of an employee.
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER prevent_salary_decrease
BEFORE UPDATE ON Employee
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  IF NEW.salary < OLD.salary THEN
    SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'salary cannot be decreased';
  END IF;
END;
```

#### l. When inserting a new certification for an employee, check that the aircraft ID exists in the Aircraft.
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER check_aircraft_exists
BEFORE INSERT ON Certified
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  IF (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Aircraft WHERE aircraft_id = NEW.aircraft_id) = 0 THEN
    SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Aircraft does not exist';
  END IF;
END;
```

#### m. When making modifications to the Aircraft table, check that the cruising range is greater than or equal to the distance of flights.
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER check_cruising_range
BEFORE UPDATE ON Aircraft
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  IF NEW.cruising_range < (SELECT MAX(distance) FROM Flight WHERE aircraft_id = OLD.aircraft_id) THEN
    SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Cruising range must be greater than or equal to flight distance';
  END IF;
END;
```

#### n. When a new certification is inserted into Certified, also insert an employee with the ID and a NULL salary.
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER insert_employee_on_certification
AFTER INSERT ON Certified
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO Employee (employee_id, salary) VALUES (NEW.employee_id, NULL);
END;
```

#### o. Terminate pilots and their certification when the pilot retires.
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER retire_pilot
AFTER DELETE ON Pilot
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM Certified WHERE employee_id = OLD.employee_id;
END;
```

#### p. Prevent the average salary of employees from dropping below Rs. 50,000.
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER prevent_avg_salary_drop
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON Employee
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  IF (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employee) < 50000 THEN
    SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Average salary cannot drop below Rs. 50,000';
  END IF;
END;
```


Here’s the implementation of stored procedures using **Cursors** and **Exception Handling** for the corresponding queries on both **Employee Schema** and **Flight Schema**.

    -- Cursor to loop through departments
    DECLARE cur CURSOR FOR SELECT department_id FROM Department;
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done = TRUE;
    
    OPEN cur;
    read_loop: LOOP
        FETCH cur INTO dept_id;
        IF done THEN
            LEAVE read_loop;
        END IF;
        
        -- Calculate average salary and employee count
        SELECT AVG(salary), COUNT(*) INTO avg_salary, num_employees FROM Employee WHERE department_id = dept_id;
        
        -- Handle exception if invalid department
        IF num_employees = 0 THEN
            SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Invalid department number';
        END IF;
        
        -- Display department summary
