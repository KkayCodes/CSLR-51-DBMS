**y. Create your own query:**
Define what you want to do, then write the query.

This depends on your custom requirement. Could you provide more details?

### **2. Continuation to Session 04 Exercise: Execute Queries for TRIGGER, VIEW, EXCEPT, and CONTAINS**

This would involve executing example queries from the specified sections of the textbook. Youâ€™ll need to refer to the corresponding textbook examples for exact query structures.

### **3. Triggers on EMPLOYEE Schema**

**a. Assure that deleting details of an employee deletes his dependent records also.**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER DeleteEmployee
AFTER DELETE ON Employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM Dependents WHERE eid = OLD.eid;
END;
```

**b. Ensure that when a department with exactly one project is shifted to a new location, the project is also shifted.**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER ShiftDepartment
AFTER UPDATE ON Department
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Project WHERE dept_id = OLD.dept_id) = 1
BEGIN
  UPDATE Project SET location = NEW.location WHERE dept_id = OLD.dept_id;
END;
```

**c. Assure that no department has more than 3 projects.**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER LimitProjects
BEFORE INSERT ON Project
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Project WHERE dept_id = NEW.dept_id) >= 3
BEGIN
  SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Department cannot have more than 3 projects';
END;
```

**d. Ensure no employees work for more than one department.**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER OneDepartment
BEFORE INSERT ON WorksFor
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM WorksFor WHERE eid = NEW.eid) > 1
BEGIN
  SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Employee cannot work for more than one department';
END;
```

**e. When a project is dropped, dissociate all employees from that project.**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER DropProject
AFTER DELETE ON Project
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM WorksOn WHERE project_id = OLD.project_id;
END;
```

**f. Ensure no new department is co-located with any other department.**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER UniqueLocation
BEFORE INSERT ON Department
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Department WHERE location = NEW.location) > 0
BEGIN
  SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'No two departments can have the same location';
END;
```

**g. Ensure every employee's dependent birthdate is less than the employee's birthdate.**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER ValidDependentBirthdate
BEFORE INSERT ON Dependents
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN NEW.birthdate >= (SELECT birthdate FROM Employees WHERE eid = NEW.eid)
BEGIN
  SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Dependent birthdate must be earlier than employee birthdate';
END;
```

**h. Increment 1000 rupees to the salary for those employees if any of their dependents expire.**

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER IncrementSalaryOnDependentDeath
AFTER DELETE ON Dependents
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  UPDATE Employees SET salary = salary + 1000 WHERE eid = OLD.eid;
END;
```
