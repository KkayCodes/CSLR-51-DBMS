        Dnumber INT,
        Dlocation VARCHAR(30),
        PRIMARY KEY (Dnumber, Dlocation),
        FOREIGN KEY (Dnumber) REFERENCES Department(Dnumber)
    );
    ```

4. **Project**
    ```sql

        Dnum INT,
        FOREIGN KEY (Dnum) REFERENCES Department(Dnumber)
    );
    ```

5. **Works_on**
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Works_on (
        Essn CHAR(9),
        Pno INT,
        Hours DECIMAL(3, 1),
        PRIMARY KEY (Essn, Pno),
        FOREIGN KEY (Essn) REFERENCES Employee(Ssn),
        FOREIGN KEY (Pno) REFERENCES Project(Pnumber)
    );
    ```

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Dependent (
        Essn CHAR(9),
        Dependent_name VARCHAR(30),
        Sex CHAR(1),
        Bdate DATE,
        Relationship VARCHAR(30),
