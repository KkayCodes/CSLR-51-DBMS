# Lab 3 : Implementing Design Schema

## 1. Designing the Company Schema

Below is the Company Schema based on the provided figure:

#### Employee Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    Fname VARCHAR(50),
    Minit CHAR(1),
    Lname VARCHAR(50),
    Ssn CHAR(9) PRIMARY KEY,
    Bdate DATE,
    Address VARCHAR(100),
    Sex CHAR(1),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Super_ssn CHAR(9),
    Dno INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Super_ssn) REFERENCES Employee(Ssn),
    FOREIGN KEY (Dno) REFERENCES Department(Dnumber)
);
```

#### Department Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Department (
    Dname VARCHAR(50),
    Dnumber INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Mgr_ssn CHAR(9),
    Mgr_start_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (Mgr_ssn) REFERENCES Employee(Ssn)
);
```

### 2. Executing Basic Queries

#### 2.1 CREATE

```sql
-- Creating Employee Table
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    Fname VARCHAR(50),
    Minit CHAR(1),
    Lname VARCHAR(50),
    Ssn CHAR(9) PRIMARY KEY,
    Bdate DATE,
    Address VARCHAR(100),
    Sex CHAR(1),
    Salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Super_ssn CHAR(9),
    Dno INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Super_ssn) REFERENCES Employee(Ssn),
    FOREIGN KEY (Dno) REFERENCES Department(Dnumber)
);

-- Creating Department Table
CREATE TABLE Department (
    Dname VARCHAR(50),
    Dnumber INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Mgr_ssn CHAR(9),
    Mgr_start_date DATE,
    FOREIGN KEY (Mgr_ssn) REFERENCES Employee(Ssn)
);
```

#### 2.2 INSERT

```sql
-- Inserting into Employee Table
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES ('John', 'B', 'Smith', '123456789', '1965-01-09', '731 Fondren, Houston, TX', 'M', 30000, '333445555', 5);
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES ('Franklin', 'T', 'Wong', '333445555', '1955-12-08', '638 Voss, Houston, TX', 'M', 40000, '888665555', 5);

-- Inserting into Department Table
INSERT INTO Department VALUES ('Research', 5, '333445555', '1988-05-22');
INSERT INTO Department VALUES ('Administration', 4, '987654321', '1995-01-01');
```

#### 2.3 DELETE

```sql
-- Deleting from Employee Table
DELETE FROM Employee WHERE Ssn = '123456789';
```

#### 2.4 UPDATE (or MODIFY)

```sql
-- Updating Employee Salary
UPDATE Employee
SET Salary = Salary * 1.10
WHERE Ssn = '333445555';
```

#### 2.5 ALTER

```sql
-- Adding a new column to the Employee Table
ALTER TABLE Employee
ADD Email VARCHAR(50);
```

### 3. Entity Integrity Constraints

The `Ssn` field in the `Employee` table and the `Dnumber` field in the `Department` table are primary keys, ensuring that each record is unique and not null.

### 4. Referential Integrity Constraints

Foreign keys (`Super_ssn` and `Dno` in `Employee` table, `Mgr_ssn` in `Department` table) ensure that values must exist in the referenced table.

```sql
-- Example: Ensuring Referential Integrity Constraint
INSERT INTO Employee VALUES ('Ahmad', 'V', 'Jabbar', '987979879', '1969-03-29', '980 Dallas, Houston, TX', 'M', 25000, '987654321', 4);
```

## Basic Queries (Chapter 6)


### Query 0. Retrieve the birth date and address of the employee(s) whose name is ‘John B. Smith’.
```sql
SELECT Bdate, Address
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE Fname = ‘John’ AND Minit = ‘B’ AND Lname = ‘Smith’;
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b58e820-7653-4c14-9bf9-0c3d2f6b0611)

### Query 1. Retrieve the name and address of all employees who work for the ‘Research’ department.

```sql
SELECT Fname, Lname, Address
FROM EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT
WHERE Dname = ‘Research’ AND Dnumber = Dno;
```

### Query 2. For every project located in ‘Stafford’, list the project number, the controlling department number, and the department manager’s last name, address, and birth date.

```sql
SELECT Pnumber, Dnum, Lname, Address, Bdate
FROM PROJECT, DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE
WHERE Dnum = Dnumber AND Mgr_ssn = Ssn AND
Plocation = ‘Stafford
```

### 6.3.2 Ambiguous Attribute Names, Aliasing, Renaming, and Tuple Variables

The same name can be used for two (or more) attributes as long as the
attributes are in different tables. 

```sql
SELECT Fname, EMPLOYEE.Name, Address
FROM EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT
WHERE DEPARTMENT.Name = ‘Research’ AND
DEPARTMENT.Dnumber = EMPLOYEE.Dnumber;
```

Fully qualified attribute names can be used for clarity even if there is no ambi-
guity in attribute names.

```sql
SELECT EMPLOYEE.Fname, EMPLOYEE.LName,
EMPLOYEE.Address
FROM EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT
WHERE DEPARTMENT.DName = ‘Research’ AND
DEPARTMENT.Dnumber = EMPLOYEE.Dno
```

###  Query 8 :  For each employee, retrieve the employee’s first and last name and the first and last name of his or her immediate supervisor

```sql
Q8: SELECT E.Fname, E.Lname, S.Fname, S.Lname
FROM EMPLOYEE AS E, EMPLOYEE AS S
WHERE E.Super_ssn = S.Ssn;
```

We can use this alias-naming or renaming mechanism in any SQL query to specify
tuple variables for every table in the WHERE clause, whether or not the same rela-
tion needs to be referenced more than once. 

```sql
SELECT E.Fname, E.LName, E.Address
FROM EMPLOYEE AS E, DEPARTMENT AS D
WHERE D.DName = ‘Research’ AND D.Dnumber = E.Dno;
```

### Queries 9 and 10. Select all EMPLOYEE Ssns (Q9) and all combinations of EMPLOYEE Ssn and DEPARTMENT Dname (Q10) in the database.

Q9: 

```sql
SELECT Ssn
FROM EMPLOYEE;
```
Q10: 
```sql
SELECT Ssn, Dname
FROM EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT;
```

Query Q1C retrieves all the attribute values of any EMPLOYEE who works in
DEPARTMENT number 5 (Figure 6.3(g)), query Q1D retrieves all the attributes of an
EMPLOYEE and the attributes of the DEPARTMENT in which he or she works for
every employee of the ‘Research’ department, and Q10A specifies the CROSS
PRODUCT of the EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT relations.


Q1C: 

```sql
SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE Dno = 5;
```

Q1D: 
```sql
SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT
WHERE Dname = ‘Research’ AND Dno = Dnumber;
```

Q10A: 
```sql
SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT;
```

### Query 11. Retrieve the salary of every employee (Q11) and all distinct salary values (Q11A).
Q11: 
```sql
SELECT ALL Salary
FROM EMPLOYEE;
```

Q11A:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT Salary
FROM EMPLOYEE;
```

### Query 4. Make a list of all project numbers for projects that involve an employee whose last name is ‘Smith’, either as a worker or as a manager of the department that controls the project.

Q4A: 
```sql
( SELECT DISTINCT Pnumber
FROM PROJECT, DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE
WHERE Dnum = Dnumber AND Mgr_ssn = Ssn
AND Lname = ‘Smith’ )
UNION
( SELECT DISTINCT Pnumber
FROM PROJECT, WORKS_ON, EMPLOYEE
WHERE Pnumber = Pno AND Essn = Ssn
AND Lname = ‘Smith’ )
```

Query 12. Retrieve all employees whose address is in Houston, Texas.

Q12:
```sql
SELECT Fname, Lname
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE Address LIKE ‘%Houston,TX%’;
```

Query 12A. Find all employees who were born during the 1950s.
Q12: 
```sql
SELECT Fname, Lname
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE Bdate LIKE ‘_ _ 7 _ _ _ _ _ _ _’;
```

Query 13. Show the resulting salaries if every employee working on the
‘ProductX’ project is given a 10% raise.

Q13: 
```sql
SELECT E.Fname, E.Lname, 1.1 * E.Salary AS Increased_sal
FROM EMPLOYEE AS E, WORKS_ON AS W, PROJECT AS P
WHERE E.Ssn = W.Essn AND W.Pno = P.Pnumber AND
P.Pname = ‘ProductX’;
```

Query 14. Retrieve all employees in department 5 whose salary is between
$30,000 and $40,000.
Q14: 
```sql
SELECT *
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE (Salary BETWEEN 30000 AND 40000) AND Dno = 5;
```

Query 15. Retrieve a list of employees and the projects they are working on,
ordered by department and, within each department, ordered alphabetically by
last name, then first name.

Q15: 

```sql
SELECT D.Dname, E.Lname, E.Fname, P.Pname
FROM DEPARTMENT AS D, EMPLOYEE AS E, WORKS_ON AS W,
PROJECT AS P
WHERE D.Dnumber = E.Dno AND E.Ssn = W.Essn AND W.Pno =
P.Pnumber
ORDER BY D.Dname, E.Lname, E.Fname;
```
