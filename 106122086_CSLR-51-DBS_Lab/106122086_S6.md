### Step 4: Write and Execute Queries


---

```sql
SELECT title 
FROM course 
WHERE dept_name = 'CSE' AND credits = 3;
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/78161b07-d978-4983-a329-12394825a892)


### **b. Find the highest salary of any professor:**
```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) AS highest_salary 
FROM professor;
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a0bb024-b72a-43fd-a2f1-8d73727b53fa)


### **c. Find all professors earning the highest salary (there may be more than one with the same salary):**
```sql
SELECT name, salary 
FROM professor 
WHERE salary = (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM professor);
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a40154e-046f-4d72-98de-9b20c7c82730)



### **d. Find the maximum enrollment, across all sections, in Fall 2020:**
```sql
SELECT MAX(count) AS max_enrollment
FROM (
    SELECT COUNT(takes.sID) AS count
    FROM section 
    JOIN takes ON section.course_id = takes.course_id AND section.sec_id = takes.sec_id 
    WHERE section.semester = 'Fall' AND section.year = 2020
    GROUP BY section.course_id, section.sec_id
) AS enrollment;
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/172b5cb2-a98e-4155-a480-941edb2015b8)



### **e. Find the enrollment of each section that was offered in Spring 2019:**
```sql
SELECT section.course_id, section.sec_id, COUNT(takes.sID) AS enrollment
FROM section 
LEFT JOIN takes ON section.course_id = takes.course_id AND section.sec_id = takes.sec_id 
WHERE section.semester = 'Spring' AND section.year = 2019
GROUP BY section.course_id, section.sec_id;
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e7f872e-6169-49c5-8369-b8fc8dbcb6e0)



### **f. Find the IDs and names of all students who have not taken any course offering before Spring 2013:**
```sql
SELECT student.pID, student.name
FROM student
WHERE student.pID NOT IN (
    SELECT takes.sID
    FROM takes
    WHERE (takes.year < 2013 OR (takes.year = 2013 AND takes.semester = 'Spring'))
);
```

### **g. Find the lowest, across all departments, of the per-department maximum salary computed by the preceding query:**
```sql
SELECT MIN(max_salary) AS lowest_max_salary
FROM (
    SELECT dept_name, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
    FROM professor
    GROUP BY dept_name
) AS dept_max_salaries;
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d6696a3-aa84-4481-ace4-5ececaaac197)

### **h. Create a new course “CS-001”, titled “Weekly Seminar”, with 1 credit:**
```sql
INSERT INTO course (course_id, title, dept_name, credits)
VALUES ('CS-001', 'Weekly Seminar', 'CSE', 1);
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5cb83c58-b046-445f-ad68-932232dbbd60)


### **i. Delete the course CS-001. What will happen if you run this delete statement without first deleting offerings (sections) of this course?**
```sql
DELETE FROM course WHERE course_id = 'CS-001';
```
before:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df79dbbb-2952-4825-b326-fb1cf2ea699f)

after:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eecdeef2-128d-4780-ac7f-ead8b311ee91)


**Explanation:** If there are entries for `CS-001` in other related tables (like `section`, `takes`, or `prereq`), the `DELETE` will fail due to foreign key constraints. You need to delete or update related entries in those tables first.

### **j. Display the list of all course sections offered in Spring 2022, along with the names of the professors teaching the section. If a section has more than one professor, it should appear as many times in the result as it has professors. If it does not have any professors, it should still appear in the result with the professor name set to “-”:**
```sql
SELECT section.course_id, section.sec_id, professor.name
FROM section
LEFT JOIN teaches ON section.course_id = teaches.course_id AND section.sec_id = teaches.sec_id AND section.semester = teaches.semester AND section.year = teaches.year
LEFT JOIN professor ON teaches.pID = professor.pID
WHERE section.semester = 'Spring' AND section.year = 2022
UNION
SELECT section.course_id, section.sec_id, '-' AS name
FROM section
WHERE section.semester = 'Spring' AND section.year = 2022 AND section.course_id NOT IN (SELECT course_id FROM teaches);
```

### **k. Find the professor ID, name, dept_name, and salary for professors whose salary is greater than 50,000:**
```sql
SELECT pID, name, dept_name, salary 
FROM professor
WHERE salary > 50000;

```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f660ef4b-67fa-46f8-b46a-f8a7e7da8773)
